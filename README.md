## Objective

This Home Lab is an introductory project aimed to implement the fundamentals and thoery based knowledge I've gained so far into practice. From creating virtual machines using different hypervisors, to how to properly configure them to suit different and specific environmental needs, to breaking stuff and learning how to restore full system functionalities.

### Skills Learned

- Operating System Installation & Configuration
- Networking Fundamentals
- Snapshots & Backups
- Security & Isolation
- Command Line Proficiency
- Troubleshooting, Diagnostics & Root Cause Analysis
- Data Analysis & Interpretation
- Search Processing Language (SPL)
- Monitoring & Alert Configuration
- Security & Threat Analysis

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system (such as Splunk) for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Using Metasploit and Burpsuite to simulate different attack vectors.
